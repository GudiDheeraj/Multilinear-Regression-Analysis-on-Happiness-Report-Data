# Multilinear Regression Analysis on Happiness Report Data

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and analysis for the group project titled "Multilinear Regression Analysis on Happiness Report Data." This project is part of the "Introduction to Statistics for Data Science" course (MATH42715_2023) at Durham University, conducted by Group 14 of the Masters in Data Science program.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze global happiness determinants using multivariate linear regression models. The study focuses on data from 137 countries across six continents, with variables including GDP, Health Life Expectancy (HLE), Freedom, Corruption, and Continent, to assess their impact on the happiness scores of nations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is derived from the World Happiness Report 2023. It includes the following key variables:

- **Logarithmic value of GDP (LGDP)**
- **Health Life Expectancy (HLE)**
- **Freedom**
- **Corruption**
- **Continent**
- **Happiness Ladder Score**

## Key Findings

1. **Global Insights**:
   - GDP, social support, and HLE are pivotal to national happiness.
   - Regional variations highlight the importance of socioeconomic and cultural factors in policy-making.

2. **Regional Recommendations**:
   - **Europe**: Integrate technology into healthcare and enhance public transportation.
   - **Asia**: Implement transparent government procurement processes and establish community centers.
   - **North America**: Support small businesses through grants and combat government corruption with community-led watchdog groups.
   - **South America**: Develop telemedicine services and microfinance programs.
   - **Africa**: Promote government transparency and invest in renewable energy projects.

## Methodology

The project employs a comprehensive multivariate linear regression approach. Key steps include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution and identify outliers.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Predictive modeling to estimate missing values, validated using historical data.

3. **Building Regression Models**:
   - Multiple linear regression models are built and evaluated, including models by continent to account for regional differences.
